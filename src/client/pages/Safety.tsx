            How to stay safe online

          <div className="answer">
            Though the vast majority of people want to help you find your next home, despite our best efforts there will always be a small number of fraudsters
            out there who want to try and trick you into giving up some of your personal details or parting with money.
            <br />
            <p>One of our top tips in staying safe online is being careful when being asked to pay money before you see a property</p>
            <p>
              We recommend you always see the property before paying any money. If you are unable to visit the property, ask someone you trust to do so on your
              behalf.
